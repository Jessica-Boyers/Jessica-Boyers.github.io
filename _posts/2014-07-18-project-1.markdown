description: >
  Polymer ligation is a +$100M market for Teleflex Medical. The predicate product had been unchanged since the late '90s and all relevant patents expired. Market research over the last 2 decades identified several pain points and unsolved clinical needs in the use of polymer clip systems. I was technical lead of the 'Next Gen Hem-o-lok' project to totally redesign the entire system: Clip, Cartridge, Applier, and Remover. We successfully developed and tested a new design that maintained the same user experiences clinicians had trained to while also resolving the two most common complaints.
